      <h1>A Midsummer Night's Dream</h1>
      <p>Over hill, over dale, thorough bush, thorough brier, over park, over pale, thorough flood, thorough fire. I do wander everywhere swifter than the moon's sphere.</p>

      <h1>The Tempest</h1>
      <p>And like the baseless fabric of this vision, the cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces, The solemn temples, the great globe itself- Yea, all which it inheritâ€”shall dissolve, And like this insubstantial pageant faded, leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little life is rounded with a sleep.</p>
